[founders](founders.md)


We continue to invest heavily to take our products into global markets. We are showing some very good win. So we do want to be a very broad Fintech player. If you see what Stripe is doing, what Adyen is doing, a very similar playbook is being followed here in Pine Labs and that is what makes us unique.

So these are very real use cases that we are doing using AI today, and that is ensuring that we really do not need to scale in terms of hiring more engineers. Again, I am very clear at this point of time, we have got enough engineering talent within the company. I do not see Pine Labs increasing the number of engineers going forward. If any, it could actually go down, but surely not increase.
