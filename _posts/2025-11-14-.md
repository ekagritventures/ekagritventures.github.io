So, [Pine Labs](/Companies/Pine-Labs) got listed today. I watched it live. Nifty closed at 25,910. I have been checking it since it has been 21000. I am clearly a novice in the markets and I have to learn a lot. I have to learn because in order to generate ideas you need to pattern match and that comes from learning a lot of things.

I have watched a couple of [Alix Pasquet](/People/Alix%20Pasquet)'s videos and they are phenomenal. It's a game of reps, reps and reps.
