Presenting **ekagrit ventures**, a platform where I get to ramble about finance and startups. This first post starts with my entry into the capital markets. I have put some money here and there before. Nothing significant as such.

This time, I have gone into the markets by applying for IPOs. I think it is a significant moment for any investor to apply to their first IPO. I applied for [Groww](Companies/Groww) and [Pine Labs](/Companies/Pine-Labs) . [Groww](/Companies/Groww/) has given *22.9%* gain in 2 days. Alas, I didn't get the allotment. However, there is such a thing as beginner's luck in the market, and to my surprise. I have been allotted a lot of 
[Pine Labs](/Companies/Pine-Labs). It opens tomorrow, and ekagrit ventures opens now.

***Welcome aboard, ladies and gentlemen!***
