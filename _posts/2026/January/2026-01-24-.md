Markdown files are becoming a new thing for this AI thing. As AI moves forward, I see markdown as being the default version of telling the AI want to do. Instead of writing *'.sh'* files, you can just define the steps in *'.md'* and you'll have a pretty robust system to work with.

Still quite early, but faster adoption cycles are there.
