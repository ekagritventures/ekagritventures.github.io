## What did I read today?

[Boring Tiny Tools](https://vaughntan.org/boringtinytools)


This is what I have been doing since the last year and that lead me to this tweet this:
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">everyone is now a forward deployed engineer. if they want to be.</p>&mdash; tatva (@tatvadesai) <a href="https://twitter.com/tatvadesai/status/2011510885890871544?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 14, 2026</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


## What did I watch today?

FLAME university has some extremely wonderful gems in their investing playlist.

I watched one by Utpal Sheth today, the one on Terminal value being a  function of Intangibles, Mega Trends and Leadership. Also, came across the only(!) interview of Pulak Prasad today.
